# RestaurantApp_SQLite:

| Android Studio | Java | SQLite | Google Maps Api

For this project, we created an app with Android to improve the user experience for a small business.  

It has been decided to add a home screen that presents
the corporate image of the small restaurant. At the same time, the app automatically updates and brings the products into the background. 

This app offers its customers the possibility of storing their favorite products on the phone. With SQLite, there is no issue if a Customer doesn't have an internet connection because they can still check the prices and characteristics of the products they have liked.

# Characteristics of the app: 

1. Home screen "splash," which stays running while in the background, prepares the data of the products that it will show. While doing so, it will display an animated image representative of the Restaurant store for at least 5 seconds, along with a progress bar.
2. Notification messages pre-designed and personalized dialogs are added.
3.The list is displayed on the screen with example images showing the SQLite database as storage for some data or products
customer favorites, where it is evidenced that you save, delete, and update these products (CRUD).
4. The Google maps API is used to show the location of the restaurant branches.
